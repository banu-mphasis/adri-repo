# ADR-001: IN-2 Sample ADR - Feature Enhancement

- **Status**: Draft
- **Date**: 2025-07-29

## Context

The current feature does not meet the user requirements as reported in IN-2.

## Decision

We will implement a new feature to address these issues, which includes adding support for real-time notifications and improved data visualization.

## Consequences

This decision aims to improve user satisfaction by providing more interactive features. Potential risks include increased complexity of codebase but we believe the benefits outweigh this.
