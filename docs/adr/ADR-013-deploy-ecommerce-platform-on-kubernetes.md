# ADR-013: Deploy Ecommerce Platform on Kubernetes

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Date**: 2025-08-26

## Context

The ecommerce platform must handle variable traffic, provide high availability, and support rapid feature rollouts. Traditional VM-based deployments lack the flexibility and automation needed for modern microservices architectures.

## Decision

Adopt Kubernetes as the deployment platform for all microservices in the ecommerce stack, including front‑end, API gateway, product catalog, order processing, and payment services.

## Consequences

Deploying the ecommerce platform on Kubernetes will increase operational complexity and require expertise in container orchestration, but it will provide improved scalability, resilience, and easier rolling updates. It also enables automated scaling based on traffic and better resource utilization. However, it introduces a learning curve for the team and may increase costs due to cluster management overhead.
