# ADR-008: Sensor Security Implementation

- **Status**: todo
- **Date**: 2025-08-15

## Context

The current system lacks robust security measures for sensor data. This ADR aims to define the approach and implementation details.

## Decision

We will implement encryption at rest and in transit, and add authentication mechanisms for sensor access.

## Consequences

This decision will enhance data protection but may increase complexity and development time.
