# ADR-014: ADR: Design User Registration Form UI

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Date**: 2025-09-05

## Context

The project requires a user registration form that collects user details such as name, email, password, and optional profile picture. The form must validate inputs, provide real‑time feedback, and integrate with the backend authentication service. The UI should be accessible, responsive, and consistent with the existing application theme.

## Decision

Adopt Material-UI (MUI) components for the registration form, leveraging its built‑in validation, theming, and accessibility features. Use MUI’s TextField, Button, and FormControl components, and apply custom styles via the theme overrides to match the brand colors. The form will be built as a React functional component using hooks for state management.

## Consequences

Using a component library (e.g., Material-UI) ensures consistency across the application, reduces development time, and improves accessibility. However, it introduces a dependency on the library and may limit custom styling flexibility. The chosen design will be responsive and follow the company’s design system, which may require future updates if the design system evolves.
